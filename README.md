# nlp-project-Introduction
1. This is the code repository for our NLP project Table-based fact verification. We intend to use three different models and algorithms : i) **LPA**, ii) **Table-BERT** and, iii) **TABERT** to verify table based fact verification using the dataset given in Table-BERT paper.
2. Each subdirectory have their respective `README` file which describes how to run test data on the pretrained models we have trained using different configurations as described in our report on the mentioned dataset.
